# CSE441-DES372

**Project Description:** An installation that allows students at the UW to see what drives their peers. and also allows those students to tell others what drives them. The intention is to provide students with new perspectives on their peers and a better understanding of what keeps us all motivated to be at the UW.

**Service Need:** In our research we found that people tend to stick to their own communities on campus. And since the UW campus is so large, the sense of community at UW as a whole isn’t so strong. It’s hard for students to empathize with others on campus because of the size, the dispersed groups of students, and the lack of interaction between these groups, whether that be based off of major, culture, or special interest.

**Project Purpose & Scope:** Encourage community building and empathy between students at the UW, through common goals that students may have as well as open them up to new perspectives.
